# Comprehensive Data Breach Database (2011-2023)

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive database of data breaches that occurred between 2011 and 2023. The dataset includes detailed information about each breach, categorized into specific parameters such as organization name, type, description of the breach, country, financial impacts, reputational impacts, method of breach, and source of news. This dataset is intended for use in thorough data analysis to understand trends and patterns in data breaches over time.

## Data Collection

The data collection process involved extensive research to compile information on data breaches from various sources including:
- Official reports and statements from affected organizations
- News articles and press releases
- Industry-specific databases and forums

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized in a structured format with each breach entry containing the following information:
- **Year**: Year when the breach occurred

## Data Analysis

We will conduct extensive data analysis on this dataset to:
- Identify trends and patterns in data breaches over time
- Analyze the impact of different breach parameters on financial and reputational consequences
- Investigate common methods and vulnerabilities exploited in data breaches
- Provide insights for improving cybersecurity strategies and policies
