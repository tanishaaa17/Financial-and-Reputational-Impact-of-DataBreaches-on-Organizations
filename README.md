This project involves conducting extensive research to compile a comprehensive database of data breaches that occurred from 2011 to 2023. We gathered detailed information about each breach, including the affected organization, the nature and impact of the breach, the financial and reputational consequences. This dataset will be used for a thorough data analysis to understand trends over time.
